# Possessive Potato

> **AI-Generated Project Disclaimer**
>
> This project was developed entirely through AI-assisted programming using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), Anthropic's CLI tool for Claude. The codebase, documentation, and configurations were generated by **Claude Opus 4.6** (`claude-opus-4-6`). While the code has been reviewed and tested, users should be aware of its AI-generated nature and exercise appropriate diligence when using it in production environments.

A self-hostable, open-source Discord alternative built with Go, React, and WebRTC.
